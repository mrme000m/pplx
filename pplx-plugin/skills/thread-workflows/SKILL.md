# Thread Workflows

Work with Perplexity thread history in a token-efficient way.

## Retrieval Strategy

1. Start with `list_threads` and a search term.
2. Fetch only likely matches with `get_thread`.
3. Extract durable identifiers: slug, context UUID, backend UUID, title.
4. Summarize rather than paste raw thread JSON.
5. Preserve follow-up IDs before compaction.

## Summary Template

```markdown
## Thread Summary: <title>
- Slug/context: <ids>
- Topic: <topic>
- Key answers: <bullets>
- Decisions/code patterns: <bullets>
- Sources: <short list>
- Follow-up opportunities: <bullets>
```

## Cross-Thread Analysis

For many threads, use the `thread-analyzer` agent. Compare repeated answers, conflicts, cited sources, and decisions.

## CLI Fallback

```bash
pplx threads list --search "topic" --limit 20
pplx threads get <slug>
bash <plugin>/scripts/pplx-summarize.sh <slug>
```

Ask before destructive operations such as delete.
